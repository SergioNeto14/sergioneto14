### This is about what I do...
A Data Scientist with passion for what all the new oil can bring to us!
I'm currently a Data Consultant at multiple tasks in LATAM operations of Bayer, through the name of Maxxi!

Specialized in solving data problems, you would be surprised (contains ironic thinking) about my hard skills, such as:
- Knowledge in languages like: SQL, Python, VBA, Javascript, Java.
- Tools as: Tableau, Power BI, plotting libs in Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Graduated in Math, Concluded MBA in Data Science, i'm currently at my last year to be graduated in Computer Engineering.

Some facts:
- My last task from Math graduation was a prediction of paper waste on schools' classrooms from SÃ£o Paulo.
- Currently I still do not stop to calculate all numbers I see. That's some sort of a good problem.
- I love to chat. Mainly when I can take all info from my stakeholder.
- I learned spanish. Only to talk to my friends in service!
- Machine Learning is more than house prices or titanic predictions. That's for sure!
